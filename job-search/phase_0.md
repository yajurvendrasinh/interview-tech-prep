### Steps to greatness

### Phase 0: Accessing Skills and Filling the Gaps

- Learning "how to become a software engineer" is a scary and nebulous goal.
- Learning how to learn and becoming a self-reliant engineer is part of that end goal.

Questions you need to ask yourself:

- What do I want to learn?
- In what order do I want to learn these topics?
- How do I know when I've fully grasped them?

How can I get there? People will do a combination of:

- Getting a formal (CS) degree
- Attending a Bootcamp
- Completing an online course
- Freelancing
- On the job training
- Personal coding projects

### Phase 1: Standing out

Four ways to convince your dream company you should get an interview:

####A damn good code sample####

- Don't make someone go find the good bits, take them directly there and
give them even more background. Why did you make the decisions you did?  What
tradeoffs did you consider? This will strengthen your application immensely.

#### Have an active technical blog####

- First, it shows passion. Don't underestimate the value of this. Companies that
care about their craft want employees that do too. Blogging regularly shows that
you care enough to learn things and share them.
- Folks want to see that you care about what you're doing and compassionate enough to teach what
you've learned to those that come after you.
- Bonus: give a lightning talk

#### Technical Interview Prep

#### Job prep: Portfolio, Github, Resume, Cover letter(s), LinkedIn profile, Angelist Profile

- Do many drafts, do your research and ask for many opinions; don't get this part wrong.

### Phase 2: getting in the door
