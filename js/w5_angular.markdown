### Angular

What is it?

- Client side framework by Google
- Created by Google internally at first. Thought it was dope so they open sourced it.
- Contributing guidelines are ridiculous.
- What HTML could have been if HTML were made for web apps.
- HTML wasn't made for web apps back in the day, it was made for web sites (static files).

What is is not

- It is not D3, Underscore, lodash
- It is NOT a DOM manipulation library
- There are no functions that we can call directly
- Not your traditional MVC (MVVC)
- It's not like Backbone

Angular vs Backbone

- You get to write less code with Angular 
- There are no dependencies to get started with Angular
- Angular is very opinionated 
- Unlike Backbone, Models are plain JS objects
- In Backbone, you had setters and getters to interact with the models. In Angular, it's just JS.
- Angular extends your HTML elements and allows you to create your own HTML elements
- Angular automatically synchronizes data between views.
- The Angular model is the single source of truth.
- This is similar to manually setting up listeners in Backbone.
- Angular implements latest tech and trends. It stays current and creates the new stuff that comes out.
- Angular stays on the bleeding edge

#### Dependency Injection

- Not unique to Angular

Three ways a module can attain a dependency
- Constructor function
- Object lookup on a global reference (window.something)
- What Angular does: dependency injection. This is when a dependency is given to a model when needed.

#### Dirty Checking
