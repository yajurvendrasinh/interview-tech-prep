Asynchronous Programming
-------

-- The Array.forEach is asynchronous, unlike the standard for loop.
-- These methods (in addition to filter, concat, etc) can be used to transform collections.

#### Observables

-- We can model asynchronous operation(s) as a collection that arrives over time. 
-- Events, animations, and asynchronous requests can be modeled as these collections.
-- That collection is called an observable.
-- Add this library using the reactive extensions.
