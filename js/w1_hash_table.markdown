### Hash Tables

**Properties of a good hash function**

- uses all input data
- uniformly distributes the data across entire set of possible hash values
- hash value fully determines result of hash

One way to handle collisions

- Use an array of linked lists. This is called separate chaining.
- Open addressing: go along our table until we go to the next available slot

Resizing

- If you have 70% slot capacity, resize up
- If you have 30% slot capacity, resize down
