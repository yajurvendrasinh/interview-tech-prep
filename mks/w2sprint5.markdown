### Intro to Client and Server

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs) is a great tool for playing around with APIs.

### HTTP requests

- **GET** request: ask for data from server. Client expects to receive data in a **response body** from server.
- **POST** request: change data on server. Server expects to receive data in a **request** body from client.
- **content-type** header informs the client or server how to interpret the request body.

### Status Codes

- 200: Okay
- 400: Client error
- 500: server error

### Client

- Instance of client/server interaction
- Interface (mobile is another client interface)

### REST

- Representational State Transfer.
- It's a stateless, client-server, cacheable protocol.
- You can interact with a server in a lot of different ways.
- Different standards have come and gone (ex. SOAP).
- Right now most folks use REST (a contract for interacting with a web server.)
- The way you interact with a web resource demonstrates the intent you want to have with that resource.
- GET is the most common action (fetch data from server).
- Standardized way everyone has agreed upon to interact with a server in a particular way.
- ex. GET (fetching), POST (creating), PUT (updating), DELETE

### API Keys

- authenticate you.
