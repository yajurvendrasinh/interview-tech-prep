### What text editor do I use?

### GUIs

- Sublime Text 
  Modeled after textmate's UI and key commands.
- Atom 
  Open sourced text editor by Github.

#### Pros

- Fast.
- East to extend via macros/packages.

#### Cons

- Need to use another service to compile.
- Low support for code completion.

### Shell based editors

SSHing to server, or in the terminal
example:
$ ssh -Y psoshnin@cs.wellesley.edu

- Nano (beginner friendly, start here) 
  control-o : save
  control-x : quit

- Vim or Vi 
  i - insert
  :wq - save and quit

- Emacs 
  control-c control-s : save
  control-x control-c : quit

#### Pros of shell based editors

- Integrate well with shell utilities.
- Operations fully key-mapped, increase speed of workflow.
- Historical text editor

#### Cons

- There is no shallow end. You are jumping off the deep end.
- Follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. It doesn't come with silly things like side bars.
