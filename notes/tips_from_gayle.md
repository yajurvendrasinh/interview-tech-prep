####How to reduce stress and think about interview performance

- Take turns being on the other side of the interview.
- Get some practice as an interviewer, and it may relax you.
- The way that you think you're doing has no correlation with your actual performance. I'm evaluating you relative to other people. 
- Be comfortable with problems you do not know how to solve.
- You don't know if you're doing worse than other people.

#### Knowing algorithms

- Have a solid knowledge base.
- Do you think alg interviews are effective? Yes, they're pretty effective for identifying intelligence and problem solving skills.
- If you throw a smart person a problem, they will show good judgement. They have some baseline of knowledge.
- The company assumes: whatever knowledge they don't have, I have resources at my company to teach them.
- Algorithm interviews do have their flaws: ability to work hard and focus on their work, and work with other people is hard to test in an interview. Work ethic is really really really hard test in an interview.

- Big O questions. what is Big O time to insert into a tree? (not as likely)
	A lot questions about designing a new algorithm. 
	Careful: variables have meanings. Inserting into search tree (log of number of nodes)
	O(n) where n is the depth of the tree (they've made this mistake)
	You're better off not using n as a variable name. 
	Be cautious of when you multiply and when you add. 


####Best way to prepare for a whiteboard interview?

- Getting a lot of practice
- Baseline of knowledge: basic data structures, algorithms. Then a lot of practice.
- Major mistake: focus too much on quantity of preparation over quality.
- Do a lot of coding on paper instead of your computer
- It takes a long time to write it on the whiteboard: focus on coding modularization
- Use whichever language you're most comfortable with
- Understand the drawbacks of your language
- Python: a lot of little methods that look like constant time that aren't.
- Java: very verbose
- Your question should have a problem that you don't know the solution to. Really really rely on examples.
- What is your favorite interview question? You have two strings. One's larger. One's smaller. Write an algorithm to figure out how many permutations of the smaller string exists in the larger string. 

#### On getting that job at Google/Facebook

- Once you have one job at a prestigious company, it opens up a lot of doors down the road
- Interview process at Google/Facebook: algorithm interviews between the big ones are far more similar than different.
- Facebook: generally a little bit more structured. 2 alg, design, and culture fit/coding interview
  Each interviewer knows what they're doing and they have training. 
  They're trained and certified in a specific interview type.
  Might lower the bar for a front end developer than a backend developer
- Google: tends to be a little bit more generalist in their hiring philosophy. Hold a front end developer to the same expectations as a backend developer.


How well you interview?
	Benefits: does not impact.
	Startups: will determine salary based on interview performance.
	Bigger companies: algorithm interviews. Generally speaking no. It just determines an offer.
		Salary is determined by prior experience.
		As questions start relying more on prior experience -> yes salary can. 

Career advice you would offer women and not men? And vice versa?
	Generally speaking, no.

Women are particularly more nervous. Less willing to come out and advocate for themselves.

Skills land a job at top 10 companies:
	Two part framework: proving to the recruiter that you have the right skills
	Proving to the recruiter that you can pass their interview

	Experience to do well in the job and the interview
	Experience: develop a lot of projects
		Show that you love coding. Learn new programming languages.
		Identify yourself as a great software developer
		Demostrate that you can do well in an internship
		One way: a CS degree
		Do HackerRank coding challenges: doing coding competitions

Best kinds of projects to post on Github: 
	Just do projects. 
	What really matters is that you're doing something.
	You're coding in some language.

	Pick technologies that you're excited about.
		You'll enjoy it more.
		You're doing something.

What are great questions to ask in interviews?
Interviewing is a two way street.
	Personally I don't believe in that.
	I don't think that's true.
	You can ask all the questions, but if you don't get an offer it's irrelevant.
	Ask questions after you get an offer.

Think questions that are more technical/show more passion.
You are interested, you are curious about the company.
Definitely ask questions to show curiousity and passion.

I'm curious why you guys picked this? How did you handle this?

I would really want to know how decisions get made at the company?
	Do developers drive what features get developed?
	What is the relationship between devs and PMs?

Is C still a valuable language to learn? Yes and No.
	It's very different from other programming languages.
	You have to deal with lower level architecture.
	Good to see you've learned C. I would try Rust.

What to look for when you test a program?
	Is the person smart? 
	Are they detailed oriented and thorough?
	Don't just throw one test case at it.
		Use a more thorough process.
		Use an example to solve algorithm. Use it as a test case.
			Walk through and call it good -- DO NOT DO THIS!
			1. analyze code. walk through step by step
				really think about everything you do
			2. look for hot spots/off by one errors
				huge * of bugs are the little off by one errors
			3. throw in small test cases (don't use your huge example)
			4. try some edge cases
				one array is empty, the other is not
			hopefully by the time you get there, your code is working

			0. Assume that your code is broken
				Look to figure out why. 
				If you find a bug, that's normal.
				Think through why the bug happened.

Looks for something that makes you want to say yes.
	Don't look for things that make you want to say no.

Someone with a bunch of projects > high GPA

Good enough GPA, and then have a bunch of projects.

Arrogance/abrasiveness -- never a good reason
Excitement about solving hard problems.
Enjoying thinking.
	You don't want to be mentally lazy.
	They settle with correctness.

Three things:
	1. you can't be a jerk, regardless of how well you're doing
	2. people who are passionate about solving hard problems
		look for more than just correctness
	3. just smart

The way you are evaluated.
	1. walk away with gut feel: are you smart, are you a problem solver?
	You need to be a strong problem solver.
	It's a broad, gut feel of how strong were you technically?

	How optimal was your solution?
	What process did you take?
	How long did it take to get there?
	How many hints I gave you? When did I give you those hints? How did you respond to those hints?
	Did you test it well? When you found bugs, did you intelligently solve it?

	Be excited! Be excited throughout the entire interview.
	Make mistakes, struggle, and show passion for problem solving.
	Be as good as you can be.
