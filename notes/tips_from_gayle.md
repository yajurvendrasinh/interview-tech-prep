# October 6th Live AMA with Gayle Laakmann McDowell

- Take turns being on the other side of the interview.
- Get some practice as an interviewer, and it may relax you.
- The way that you think you're doing has no correlation with your actual performance. I'm evaluating you relative to other people. 
- Be comfortable with problems you do not know how to solve.
- Have a solid knowledge base.
- You don't know if you're doing worse than other people.
- Do you think alg interviews are effective? Yes, they're pretty effective for identifying intelligence and problem solving skills.
- If you throw a smart person a problem, they will show good judgement. They have some baseline of knowledge.
- The company assumes: whatever knowledge they don't have, I have resources at my company to teach them.
- algorithm interviews have their flaws
- ability to work hard and focus on their work, and work with other people
- work ethic: really really really hard to interview
- best way to prepare for a whiteboard interview?
  getting a lot of practice
  baseline of knowledge: basic data structures, algorithms
  then a lot of practice
  major mistake: focus too much on quantity of preparation

- Do a lot of coding on paper instead of your computer
- It takes a long time to write it on the whiteboard: focus on coding modularization

- Use whichever language you're most comfortable with
- Understand the drawbacks of your language

- Python: a lot of little methods that look like constant time that aren't.
- Java: very verbose

- Your question should have a problem that you don't know the solution to. Really really rely on examples.
