### My Coding journey

Long story short: I started off going to a liberal arts college  in undergrad having no idea what I was going to do. I originally thought econ. I really liked math but I thought I wasn't good enough to be a math major (I know :/). Prior to college I had never seen a line of code or interacted with folks who were programmers back home (grew up in a small town in Alaska).

My progression over 4 years that lead to me being an accomplished software engineer:

- 2 years academic preparation (last 2 years of undergrad)
- 1 summer coding internship
- 1 year at a startup
- 3 month coding bootcamp (tie it all in together and prep myself for an amazing job)
- 4 years from never seeing code before to being ready for my dream job

#### Timeline

- Spring 2012: Sophomore year. Take intro Java course that friend recommends. Really like it and like the department. Declare CS major.
- School year 2012-2013: Junior year. Take data structures, algorithms.
- Summer 2013: software engineering intern, Java applications.
- School year 2013-2014: Senior year, take elective courses. interview several times during the school year for full time positions in SF, nothing pans out. Feel concerned about the amount of experience I have relative to other seniors graduating for full time jobs. Realize I don't know a lot that companies want (networking concepts, SQL knowledge, web development frameworks). 
- Post grad, summer 2014: move to san francisco, interview at startups, get position as mobile integration/support engineer at a startup.
- Fall 2014-Fall 2015: work for the startup for a year. Realize I don't want to do partner/solutions engineering. Want to try to get into web development. Start learning rails.
- Spring/Summer 2015: enroll in Bloc to work on a Rails application with a mentor.
- August: cancel bloc after foundation section because I realize I'm not getting as much out of it as I could and the curriculum is meant for those at a more beginner level than myself.
- August-Sept 2015: enroll in MakerPrep to learn Javascript and meet others interested in similar goals as mine.
- Sept 2015: decide to leave the startup I'm at after they have multiple layoffs and subsequent financial/tech debt trouble.
- Sept 2015: apply for and get into makersquare
- Oct 2015: complete precourse work for makersquare, interview prep.
