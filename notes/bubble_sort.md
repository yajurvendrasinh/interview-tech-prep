### Bubble sort

#### About

#### Summary

Start with the leftmost element. If element to the right of this element has a smaller value, switch places. If not, do not do anything. Then, move to the next leftmost element. When you get to the end, repeat until no elements switch in an iteration (youâ€™ve sorted the entire list).
